# Ocean Rescue

## :loudspeaker: About
Ocean Rescue is a game similar to Pac-Man that encourages two players to collect points and defeat enemies to obtain the highest score. Ocean Rescue uses Scratch, a block-based visual programming language that you can use to create interactive games. Makey-Makey is also used. In this game, we will be teaching if/then else statements and forever loops. This game is proposed to encourage individuals to develop an interest in computer programming and languages.<br><br>
